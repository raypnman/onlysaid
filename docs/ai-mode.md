| Mode                          | Description                                | Key Features                                               |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Ask](ai-mode/ask.md)         | Natural language task execution            | Conversational AI, multi-step workflows, context awareness |
| [Query](ai-mode/query.md)     | Intelligent search & information retrieval | Semantic search, advanced filters, multi-source querying   |
| [Agentic](ai-mode/agentic.md) | Multi-agent coordination & automation      | Agent orchestration, MCP servers, trust modes              |

## Getting Started

### Choosing the Right Mode

- **Ask Mode**: Best for conversational interactions and complex task execution
- **Query Mode**: Ideal for finding specific information and data retrieval
- **Agentic Mode**: Perfect for automated workflows and multi-agent coordination

### Basic Usage

1. Select your desired AI mode from the interface
2. Input your request using natural language
3. Review and approve agent actions (if required by trust settings)
4. Monitor progress and results in real-time
