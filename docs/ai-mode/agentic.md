## Agent Coordination

### Task Distribution

The Master Agent intelligently distributes tasks based on:

- **Agent Capabilities**: Matching tasks to agent strengths
- **Resource Availability**: Considering current agent workload
- **Task Dependencies**: Understanding which tasks must complete before others
- **Parallel Processing**: Identifying tasks that can run simultaneously
- **Quality Requirements**: Selecting agents best suited for quality needs

#### Example Coordination

```
User Request: "Create a market analysis report for our Q4 planning"

Master Agent Plan:
1. web_surfer → Research current market trends and competitor data
2. RAG Agent → Find internal market data and previous analyses
3. OpenAI Agent → Analyze competitive landscape and opportunities
4. graph_plotter → Create market size and trend visualizations
5. Summarizer Agent → Compile comprehensive final report
```

### Execution Patterns

#### Parallel Processing

Multiple agents work simultaneously on different aspects:

```
Parallel Execution Example:
├── Agent A: Market size research (web_surfer)
├── Agent B: Competitor analysis (OpenAI + web_surfer)
├── Agent C: Internal data analysis (RAG Agent)
└── Agent D: Visualization preparation (graph_plotter)

Sequential Synthesis:
└── Master Agent: Combine all results into final report
```

#### Sequential Processing

Tasks that depend on previous results:

```
Sequential Execution Example:
1. web_surfer → Gather raw market data
2. OpenAI Agent → Analyze and interpret data
3. graph_plotter → Create visualizations based on analysis
4. Summarizer Agent → Create final report with insights
```

#### Hybrid Processing

Combination of parallel and sequential execution:

```
Hybrid Execution Example:
Phase 1 (Parallel):
├── web_surfer → External research
└── RAG Agent → Internal knowledge

Phase 2 (Sequential):
1. OpenAI Agent → Analyze combined data
2. graph_plotter → Create visualizations
3. Summarizer Agent → Final synthesis
```

### Error Handling & Recovery

#### Robust Error Management

**Retry Logic**: Automatic retry on temporary failures

- Network timeouts
- API rate limits
- Temporary service unavailability

**Fallback Strategies**: Alternative approaches when primary methods fail

- Use different data sources
- Employ alternative analysis methods
- Simplify complex requests

**Human Escalation**: Request user input when needed

- Ambiguous requirements
- Critical decision points
- Quality validation needs

**Graceful Degradation**: Partial completion when full execution isn't possible

- Deliver completed portions
- Explain what couldn't be completed
- Suggest next steps

#### Example Error Recovery

```
Task: "Create financial projections using market data"

Error Scenario: web_surfer fails to access external financial data

Recovery Strategy:
1. Master Agent detects failure
2. Switches to RAG Agent for historical internal data
3. OpenAI Agent creates projections based on available data
4. Summarizer Agent notes data limitations in final report
5. Suggests manual data collection for improved accuracy
```

## Trust Mode System

### High Trust Mode

**Behavior**: Agents execute tasks automatically without user confirmation

**Best For**:

- Routine data analysis and reporting
- Content generation and documentation
- Research and information gathering
- System monitoring and maintenance

**Example Workflow**:

```
User: "Update our weekly metrics dashboard"
System: ✅ Automatically executed without confirmation
Result: Dashboard updated with latest data and insights
```

**Configuration**:

- Automatic execution for predefined task types
- Minimal user interaction required
- Fast completion times
- Suitable for trusted environments

### Medium Trust Mode

**Behavior**: Agents ask for confirmation on significant actions

**Best For**:

- Strategic planning and decision support
- Content creation for external use
- Financial analysis and projections
- System configuration changes

**Example Workflow**:

```
User: "Send the quarterly report to all stakeholders"
System: ⚠️ "I'm about to send the Q4 report to 25 stakeholders.
         The report includes financial data and strategic plans. Proceed?"
User: "Yes, send it"
System: ✅ Report sent successfully
```

**Configuration**:

- Confirmation required for high-impact actions
- Preview of actions before execution
- Ability to modify before proceeding
- Balanced automation and control

### Low Trust Mode

**Behavior**: User approves each step manually

**Best For**:

- Critical business decisions
- Financial transactions
- System security changes
- Learning and training phases

**Example Workflow**:

```
User: "Analyze our customer data and create insights"
System: 🔍 "Step 1: Access customer database containing 10,000 records. Approve?"
User: "Yes"
System: 📊 "Step 2: Run sentiment analysis on customer feedback. Approve?"
User: "Yes"
System: 📈 "Step 3: Generate customer satisfaction trends. Approve?"
User: "Yes"
System: ✅ "Analysis complete. Review results?"
```

**Configuration**:

- Manual approval for each significant step
- Detailed explanation of each action
- Maximum user control and oversight
- Slower execution but highest security

### Trust Level Configuration

#### Global Settings

- Set default trust levels for different task categories
- Configure user-specific trust preferences
- Define organization-wide trust policies

#### Task-Specific Settings

- Override global settings for specific tasks
- Adjust trust levels based on data sensitivity
