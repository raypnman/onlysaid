## Best Practices

### Effective Communication

#### Be Specific

**Good**: "Create a marketing plan"
**Better**: "Create a 30-day social media marketing plan for our AI productivity tool targeting small businesses"

#### Provide Context

```
"I'm preparing for a board meeting next week. Can you create a presentation
summarizing our Q3 performance, including revenue growth, user acquisition,
and key challenges we faced?"
```

#### Use Follow-up Questions

```
Initial: "Analyze our customer churn rate"
Follow-up: "What are the main reasons for churn you identified?"
Follow-up: "Can you suggest strategies to reduce churn by 20%?"
```

#### Specify Output Format

```
"Create a project plan in Gantt chart format"
"Generate a summary in bullet points"
"Provide the analysis as a detailed report with charts"
```

### Request Optimization

#### Break Down Complex Tasks

Instead of: "Handle all our marketing needs"
Try: "Create a content calendar, then design social media posts, then set up email campaigns"

2. "Add resource allocation to the timeline"
3. "Include risk assessment for each milestone"
4. "Generate a budget breakdown for the project"
```

#### Leverage Previous Results

```
"Using the market analysis you just created, now develop a go-to-market strategy"
"Based on the customer feedback analysis, create improvement recommendations"
```

### Common Patterns

#### Research → Analysis → Action

```
1. "Research current trends in our industry"

3. "Create an action plan to capitalize on opportunities"
```

#### Data → Insights → Recommendations

```
1. "Analyze our sales data from last quarter"
