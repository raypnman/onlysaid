# AI Mode

AI Mode is the heart of Onlysaid, where natural language meets intelligent automation. This comprehensive system combines conversational AI, powerful search capabilities, and multi-agent orchestration to complete any task through simple natural language instructions.

## üß† AI Mode Overview

### What is AI Mode?

AI Mode transforms how you work by enabling:

- **Natural Language Interaction**: Simply ask for what you need in plain language
- **Intelligent Search & Retrieval**: Find information across your entire workspace
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Coordinate specialized AI agents for complex tasks
- **Automated Task Execution**: Complete workflows without manual intervention

## üéØ Quick Navigation

Choose your AI mode to explore specific capabilities:

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Choose Your Mode

1. **[Ask](ask.md)**: Start here for natural language interactions and task execution
2. **[Query](query.md)**: Use when you need to find specific information or search through data
3. **[Agentic](agentic.md)**: Explore for complex workflows and multi-agent coordination

### Integration Workflow

The three modes work seamlessly together:

```
Query ‚Üí Find relevant information
Ask ‚Üí Request task execution using found data
Agentic ‚Üí Coordinate multiple agents for complex workflows
```

## üîß Core Capabilities

### Natural Language Processing

- **Multi-language Support**: English, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and more
- **Context Awareness**: Maintains conversation history and workspace context
- **Intent Recognition**: Understands complex requests and breaks them into actionable steps

### Intelligent Search

- **Semantic Search**: Find conceptually related content, not just keyword matches
- **Multi-source Querying**: Search across documents, conversations, code, and external sources
- **Advanced Filtering**: Use operators, dates, file types, and custom filters

### Agent Orchestration

- **Specialized Agents**: Each agent has specific capabilities and expertise
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple agents can work simultaneously on different tasks
- **Trust Levels**: Configure automation levels based on task criticality

## üõ†Ô∏è Trust Mode System

Configure how much autonomy you give to AI agents:

### High Trust Mode

- **Behavior**: Agents execute tasks automatically
- **Best For**: Routine tasks, trusted environments
- **Example**: Automated reporting, data analysis

### Medium Trust Mode

- **Behavior**: Agents ask for confirmation on significant actions
- **Best For**: Important but routine tasks
- **Example**: Content creation, strategic planning

### Low Trust Mode

- **Behavior**: User approves each step manually
- **Best For**: Critical tasks, learning phase
- **Example**: Financial decisions, system changes

## üìä Performance Metrics

Track your AI Mode usage and effectiveness:

- **Task Completion Rate**: Percentage of successfully completed requests
- **Response Time**: Average time from request to completion
- **User Satisfaction**: Quality ratings and feedback scores
- **Resource Efficiency**: Computational and API usage optimization

## üîß Configuration Options

### Agent Settings

- Customize individual agent behavior and capabilities
- Set default trust levels for different types of tasks
- Configure timeout and retry policies

### Search Preferences

- Define default search scopes and filters
- Set result limits and ranking preferences
- Configure external data source connections

### Workflow Automation

- Create custom workflows for recurring tasks
- Set up scheduled operations and triggers
- Define approval processes and escalation paths

## üí° Best Practices

### Effective Communication

1. **Be Specific**: Provide clear, detailed requests
2. **Provide Context**: Include relevant background information
3. **Use Follow-ups**: Build on previous responses for better results
4. **Specify Format**: Request specific output formats when needed

### Optimization Tips

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic requests before complex workflows
2. **Learn Patterns**: Understand how agents interpret different request types
3. **Use Combinations**: Leverage multiple modes together for best results
4. **Monitor Performance**: Track success rates and adjust approaches

## üìö Advanced Features

### Multi-Modal Integration

- Combine text, images, and data in single workflows
- Process different file types and formats seamlessly
- Generate rich outputs with visualizations and reports

### External Integrations

- Connect with popular tools and platforms
- Access real-time data from APIs and databases
- Sync with cloud storage and collaboration tools

### Learning & Adaptation

- Agents learn from your usage patterns and preferences
- Continuous improvement based on feedback and results
- Organizational knowledge accumulation over time

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Slow Responses**: Check network connectivity and API limits
- **Poor Results**: Refine requests with more specific language
- **Agent Errors**: Review trust settings and task complexity
